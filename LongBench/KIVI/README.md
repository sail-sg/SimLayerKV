This part of the project is based on the [https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI](https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI). To set up, please follow these steps:

## Steps:

   First, head over to the [https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI](https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI) and clone a copy of the code:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.git
   ```

2. **Copy Code**:  
   Once you have the KIVI repository, copy all the files from the KIVI repository into this project, **except for the files provided in the `models/` directory**, as the modifications are already provided here.
